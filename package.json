  "main": "src/app/app.component.ts",
  "description": "This example demonstrates real-time data update in a DataGrid bound to a SignalR service. Access to the service is configured in a CustomStore.\nThe CustomStore fetches the remote dataset at launch and keeps its local copy. Whenever the remote dataset changes, the server calls a client-side function that updates the local copy of the dataset (updateStockPrices in this demo). This function uses the store's push(changes) method.\nFor server-side configuration, refer to the ASP.NET MVC version of this demo.\nFor more information about integration with push services, refer to the following help topic: Integration with Push Services.\nNOTE: Data used in this demo is for demonstration purposes only.\n",
